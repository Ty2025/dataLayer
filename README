The Data Layer is a virtual space between a website and server.
The Data is normally used by marketers for tracking :)



Any key:object value can be stored.

object can be of any type ( string, int, boolean )

This is a really good article on the dataLayer

IMPORTANT NOTE:
    ( Im not certain but better to be safe)
    Remember to clear you dataLayer after playing with this app as it may affect browser performance if you fill it 

    Option 1:
        navigate to dev tools Application
        if Local storage has many items in it as a list click on each one to find the local storage data named in this code
        Delete manually
    Option 2:
        if you have nothing worth keeping etc... GitHub password for auto login
        Then paste in console =>
        localStorage. clear()

The Stuff in the Data layer 

    Cookie Functionality wont work if you have an ad/tracking blocker enabled
    Im using the word cookie because it reminds me of Cookie Monster and its more fun to say

    But Local Storage & Session Storage is much better. It is the same concept as cookies but is better (go-oogle it)
